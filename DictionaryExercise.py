# Itâ€™s...not really an adventure game...#Ver 1.0
# Your village is being attacked by 'a germanic tribe' and you need to run to the stores and get the right things to
# save your village, and probably some good looking girl or boy you want to marry. All prices in gold pieces excl.
# VAT... chop chop!! ze germanz are coming!
# The code should allow you to get 1 thing from each store and each item you get should be removed from the store
# inventory, then do same for next store... one way to buy is by typing the key 'newt' in an input box...or something.
# At the end you should print the 'items' you have taken..in this version you don't have to pay for stuff or add it up
# TODO Ver 1.2
# add ability to exit a store without buying and go to next by typing 'exit', and to exit if a nonexistent item is
# bought(typed)
# Add purse with 1000 gold pieces and payment for the items during or at end of code and show a message about total
# cost and how much gold you have left.
# TODO Ver 1.4
# random bug fix, 'browser compatibility', refactoring code..basically being lazy..stop scrolling TikTok/Facebook! ;-)
# TODO Ver 1.5
# print inventory before and after purchases as one department_store of stuff(combine inventories from all stores into
# one...pretend Big Biz bought all the local stores, and want constant reporting for inventory management...)
# as in all games there is a special way to do this that actually makes money and solves the problem...can you find
# 'them'? Do you know why? May require knowledge of actual python 'lore'
